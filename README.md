# WSPPDE - Windows&trade; Scientific Portable Python Development Environment
`WSPPDE` is a free portable Python development environment for MS Windows&trade; with focus on scientific applications. WSPPDE combines Python 2.7.3  (including the third party packages IPython, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Statsmodels, wxPython) with a pre-configured Python IDE and an enhanced command console.

What WSPPDE is all about can best be seen from the screenshot below:

Details about the third party software and Python packages distributed with WSPPDE can be found in the [Package list](https://github.com/cwsoft/cwsoft-WSPPDE/blob/master/PACKAGES.md). The history of the released WSPPDE installer packages is tracked via [Changelog](https://github.com/cwsoft/cwsoft-WSPPDE/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Due to GitHubs space limits for free accounts, only the last stable WSPPDE installation package will be available in the [download section](https://github.com/cwsoft/cwsoft-WSPPDE/downloads). Optional a development version for an upcoming next WSPPD version may be provided.

## Installation
WSPPDE is distributed as a self-extracting Windows installer build with the open source tool [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page). WSPPDE was tested on MS Windows XP (32-bit) and Windows 7 (64-bit) operating system and can be used out of the box. The required installation steps are explained below.

1. Download latest [WSPPDE Windows installer](https://github.com/cwsoft/cwsoft-WSPPDE/downloads) from GitHub
2. Excecute the installer and unpack the files to the desired target directory

## Usage
WSPPDE provides two convenient methods to start Python out of the box. 

### Python IDE
If you intent to write more than a few lines of Python code, you should use the Python IDE by excecuting `Python IDE.bat`. This fires up the PyScripter IDE, which provides code highlighting, code completion, debugging, integrated help and much more.

### Python command line
If you just want to write a few lines of Python code or do some quick tests, open the enhanced Windows command line by excecuting `Console.bat`. To start the enhanced interactive Python shell [IPython](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/overview.html), enter **ipython** to the console window. If you (for whatever reason) prefer the puristic Python standard shell, enter **python** instead. Alternatively you can use the shortcuts **CTRL+F2** (Python), **CTRL+F3** (IPython), **CTRL+F4** (IPython with Pylab), **CTRL+F5** (IPython Notebook) to run the application.

To install additional Python packages from the [Python Package index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi), open the enhanced Windows command line by excecuting `Console.bat`. To install the Python package [pep8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) for example, enter one of the following two commands (depending on your preferred setup tool) to the console.

	pip install pep8
	easy_install pep8

***Tip:*** Store your Python programs, modules or packages inside the WSPPDE folder *\Repository*. This folder is included to the Python search path, so files located here can be imported from the Python interpreter, IPython or the PyScripter IDE. Details about the setup tools are shown when starting the tools with the flag `--help`.

### Excecuting Python programs
As WSPPDE is a portable Python version, the default Python filetypes (.py, pyw) are not associate with the Python interpreter by default.
Of course you can always excecute Python programs from the enhanced command console or the IDE, but there is a more convenient way to do it.
Just drag and drop a Python file (.py, pyw) on the `PyLauncher.bat` icon to execute it. 

By default packages located in the Python site-package folder or your local Repository folder are regognized and imported if required. In order to use Python files outside of these two pathes, add these pathes to the `Python27\WSPPDE.pth` file. If you want, create a shortcut of the `PyLauncher.bat` and store it e.g. at your Desktop and pimp it with a new icon.
